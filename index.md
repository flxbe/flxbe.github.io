Hi, I am Felix Bernhardt (flxbe). I am currently studying applied mathematics
in Magdeburg, Germany. In my free time I like to work on small pet projects,
which usually include writing some code.

If I find some time in the future, I'd like to use this site to talk about the
things that went wrong during these projects, which are numerous.
