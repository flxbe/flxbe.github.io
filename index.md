Hi, I am Felix Bernhardt (flxbe). I am currently doing my PhD in mathematics
at the [OVGU](https://www.ovgu.de/en/) in Magdeburg, Germany.
In my free time I like to work on small projects, which usually include writing some code.

Right now, the only content in this blog is a collection of thoughts about [software testing](./testing.html).
If I find some time in the future, I'd like to also write about the
things that went wrong during my projects, which are numerous.

I am always happy to talk about software related topics. Feel free to get in touch via email or twitter.
